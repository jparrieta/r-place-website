# Versions of the instrument

How the contracts came to their current versions, and how the population model changed during the run. All dates are 2026. [Time and costs](time.html) gives how long each stage took.

## Contract versions

Written contracts specify what each agent reads, produces and may do. We developed them through repeated runs on the same material and interviews with the agents, and revised a contract when the agents' work departed from the grounded-theory method.

**Community coders, v1 to v32.** Only v30 (102 communities) and v32 (603) coded the final data.

| Version | Date | Change | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 to v15 | August | Early contracts; v5 ran seven coders on one community | Pilots |
| v16 to v27 | 18 to 31 Aug | One coder reads each community | Runs, later recoded |
| v29 | 4 Sep | A community coder leads, with fleet coders for large communities | Pilots |
| v30 | 6 Sep | Cut for the final coding: a size threshold and a minimum slice | Coding from 7 Sep |
| v31 | 8 Sep | The community coder runs end checks before closing, after defects in 34 of 60 communities | No community is recorded under v31 |
| v32 | 9 Sep | The recording tool refuses a missing cited exclusion | Coding to 4 Oct |

**The aggregator, v28 to v43.** Versions v28, v35, v37 and v43 were run on real data; the others were development versions.

| Version | Date | Change | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| v28 | 24 Aug | The first contract, in eight stages | Run |
| v35 | to 5 Sep | Nineteen stages. The aggregator lost the method and dropped findings at counterexamples, so the method was written into its own file | Run |
| v37 | 7 Sep | Cut from 23 stages to 19, after review by the v28 and v35 aggregators and 13 rulings by us | Run, 8 to 21 Sep |
| v38 | 24 Sep | Knowledge kept on disk and decisions in context, after v37 lost context it could not see; changes from interviews with v37's checkpoints | Development |
| v40 to v42 | 2 to 3 Oct | Method changes; one contract on two platforms; longer sessions | Two runs stopped at stage A1 |
| v43 | 4 Oct | The frame of 705, questions to us, and two kinds of claim (Günther et al., 2026) | Run claude-v43-1 |
| v43.2 | 6 and 11 Oct | Fixes, including one from an interview during stage B1 | Same run |

Dates for v29 to v34 are not recorded, and v39 has no record.

## Population model versions

The run recorded each version of the model as a hash of its files, and every change in a history of 182 edits with its reason. Nothing is deleted: an element that loses its grounding becomes a candidate.

| Version | Recorded | Elements | Arrows | Sent to |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| e15f9647 | close of C5, 15 Oct | 30: 23 standing, 5 candidate, 2 tentative | 21 | the 705 community coders at D2 |
| 46384686 | frozen at D3, 24 Oct; unchanged at D6 | 45: 30 standing, 15 candidate | 21 | the 705 at the re-check |

| Stage | Dates | Edits | Added | Revised | Cut | Elements and arrows after |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| C2 | 14 Oct | 82 | 48 | 34 | 0 | 28 and 20 |
| C3 | 14 Oct | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 28 and 20 |
| C4 | 14 Oct | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 30 and 21 |
| C5 | 14 to 15 Oct | 46 | 0 | 43 | 3 | 30 and 21 |
| D3 | 16 to 24 Oct | 38 | 15 | 23 | 0 | 45 and 21 |
| D4 | 24 Oct | 10 | 0 | 10 | 0 | 45 and 21 |

The main revisions:

- **C3 and C4.** Two arrows take a mechanism from conversation analysis. Two elements and an arrow enter from r/place, the field, as tentative.
- **C5.** Three elements are cut for want of a grounded arrow; one of them is restored.
- **D3, from the community coders' returns.** The starter's role is split from joining, which the model now treats as the answer to a call. Repair is revised: it restores the form the keepers know, so a planned change is erased as damage until the keepers learn of it. r/PlaceNL is among the communities that showed this ([the example](results/placenl.html)). The field's elements and arrow become standing, and fifteen candidates enter. We froze the model as 46384686.
- **D4.** Two changes made after the freeze were reverted to proposals, restoring 46384686.
